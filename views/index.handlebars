                                My name is Tim Westberg.
                                I am currently on course to become a full stack developer. My primary work skills
                                up to this point have been in the field of bookkeeping, sales, and business
                                administration. However I have
                                been interested in coding since I was young; I dabbled in game code, mainly
                                scavening through files and discovering what had been affected.
                                My curiosity grew over time as I was more exposed to web development. This early
                                exposure prompted my enrollment in the UCSD coding bootcamp.
                                My goal is to build effective, solid web applications that effectively manage and
                                operate the vast amount of data that small business
                                process every day.</p>

                            <p class="table-para"> The projects I have built so far have given me the oppurtunity
                                to gain experience in HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript,
                                Jquery, Firebase, API's and how to understand their documentation.</p>

                                Outside of my coding life I am a student, friend, wake boarder, scuba diving

                                and hopeful travler. Coding is a passion that has really made me excited about the
                                learning process,
                                coding everyday has become an exciting process i look forward to. I hope to gain
                                employment pursing my hobbies.</p>

                                Going forward I would like to focus on developing FormulaGen into a network of

                                My goal in bringing these experienced groups together is to provide an innovative
                                and creative enviroment where both arists and designers will be able to push
                                eachother to
